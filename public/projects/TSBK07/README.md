# RayTracer on GPU

## Overview
This project was done for the course **TSBK07 - Computer Graphics** at LIU. The project is a path tracer with multiple scenes which showcases its power. There are diffuse, reflective and transmissive materials, all seen in scene 0. The path tracer has also been optimised to be able to handle a large amount of polygons, as seen in scene 3, where the stanford bunny with tens of thousand of triangles is rendered in real time on computors with somewhat decent hardware. Due to course restrictions, a library written by **ingemar Ragnemalm**

## Features
- **Real time Path Tracing**: Real time path tracing utilizing the GPU and with BVH-trees to render large scale models at high frame rate. 

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: An object-oriented programming language. C++ is a superset of the C language.

- **OpenGL**: A cross-language, multi-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.

- **VectorUtils4**: glm-like header file library which was mandatory for the course, otherwise glm would have been used.
