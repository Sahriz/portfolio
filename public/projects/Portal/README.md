# Portals

## Overview
This is a work in progress passion project where I try to recreate a portal effect. I was inspired by *Sebastian Lague* on youtube, and one of my favorite games ever is *Portal 2*, and I was reminded of this sort of effect while watching gameplay of *Marvel Rivals*. The portals currently are only looking like portals, but have no function. Sadly, heavy amounts of school work is hindering further development at the moment, but I will get back on this project as soon as possible!

## Current Features
- **Realistic Looking Portal Surfaces**: The surfaces of the portal are actually image textures that are rendered from two different cameras that move in unison with the player, one camera for each portal. The portal surface, which is really just a very thin cube, has its' texture coordinates manipulated to match with the part of the image texture that contains the portal surface. This gives a near perfect illusion of a portal sufrace. 


## Technologies Used
- **Unity**: An all purpose game engine which hosts powerfull tools for most usecases.
