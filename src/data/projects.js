      description: "A C++ library that generates terrain using several noise algorithms. The terrain currently supports both heightmap terrain and marching cubes terrain, as well as minecraft style Voxelcube terrain. The library is still a work in progress, but it is able to generate terrain in real-time using OpenGL and ComputeShaders.",
